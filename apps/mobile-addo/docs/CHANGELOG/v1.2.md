- [ ] Redesign needed for the Elsa Insight pages (have a quick Figma)... well??

For ally:

Immediate Actions:
- [x] ORS ....
- [x] Remove Symptoms from main page and move them to next page
- [x] Have translations for the DONPAR titles
- [x] Find a way to route to adding the symptoms (design seemed cluttered,  changed default reveal for the symptom on the summary screen)

Compulsory:

Notes from Dr. Kelvin:
- [x]  Translation Issue isn't proper:
	- [x] Cough / Kukohoa (not Kikohozi)
- Summary of the previous visits should be more in-depth show more information na not seem like a mis-diagnosis:
	- Example: Show *Dry Cough* instead of just *Cough*
- In profession use Non-Productive instead to be Dry
- Tree selection:
	- Dry / Productive
		- || Productive => (Yellow Sputum, Green Sputum)

Design:
- [ ] Consistency in the designs // 60%
- [x] Pick color (Elsa blue?)
- [ ] Justify the inputs with the texts.... Make the inputs all the way across
- [ ] Vertical alignments

### Way in the future:
- [ ] Assessment History Page
- [ ]  Remote + Local Inference

Hacks:
%%These are the things we should, for sure, not be doing but have done with the interest of time%%
- [x] Change dry to non-productive as text. (server still receives as `dry`). Left swahili version as `Kavu`
