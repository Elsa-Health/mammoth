# Change Logs:
- [x] Included internationalization
- [x] Steps included in the UI

### Fixes to work on
  - [x] "Elsa's thoughts" are not being updated when the user updates the symptoms from the `Summary` screen
    - [ ] Be satisying have heavily testing (without writing tests :) )
  - [x] <strike>Elsa would fataly bug out when activity is on pause state. You need to check what is wrong with this.</strike> (noticed this to be problem only on the emulator. It works fine on production mode)


### Future Updates:

#### RECENT FUTURE
  - [x] Internationalization Support
    - [x] Swahili Support
    - [x] Waiting feedback from @Thomas
      - [ ] Fully translate the app (Current 90%)
  - [x] QR code logging in
  - [ ] Change the intergration to include watermelonDB
  - [x] Firebase Sync // Statistics layer
    - [x] <strike>Need to confirm what's exactly needed for the statistics layer</strike> Confirmed.
        Information that's being currently synced is enough to recreate the distribution on:
        - sex
        - recommendation information imposed by the ADDOs

        Purposefully, prevented syncing of information related to symptoms of patients and their diagnosis (this can change, waiting on feedback)

  - [x] Force pull the "Choose a language" for the users
  - [x] Update the Symptom View based on the feedback from kibaa
    - [x] Include the delete button
    - [x] Properly present asociated symptoms
  - [x] Sort the assessment by most recent
  - [ ] Update codepush code.
    - [ ] include progress bar.
    - [ ] Include proper update mechanism in the settings area


#### LOOK AT IMMEDIATE:
  - [ ] Normalize the different shaped of data stored in the database
  - [ ] Somehow the zustand `persist` is remembering very previous information 
    - [ ] Currently, update necessitates the need to ALWAYS scan to login.
    - [ ] Try to make the login periodic (user experience)

#### WAY IN THE FUTURE
This is when everything above is done
  - [ ] Improving the Search mechanism (possible **rework**)
  - [ ] Adding CHANGELOG view into the application
  - [ ] Have a page to send feedback on the app
  - [ ] Make possible for app updates to happen silently in the background (without app being woken up... stretch?)
